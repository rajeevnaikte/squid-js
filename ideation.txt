- Problem with ViewModel vs Component. How to generalize. The typescript type return will need to have two types.
How to avoid that. Come up with a generic interface? Whats blocking? some methods are not overlaping.
e.g. addItems not in component. Should it be? ViewModel has up and down methods, hmm. It is full fledge class
of methods. Component will extend the ViewModel

- problem, need a type saying not in keyof ViewModel
